NAME
    Test::File::ShareDir - Create a Fake ShareDir for your modules for
    testing.

VERSION
    version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;

        use FindBin;

        use Test::File::ShareDir
            -root => "$FindBin::Bin/../",
            -share => {
                -module => { 'My::Module' => 'share/MyModule' }
            };

        use My::Module;

        use File::ShareDir qw( module_dir );

        module_dir( 'My::Module' ) # dir with files from $dist/share/MyModule

DESCRIPTION
    At present, this module only has support for creating test-worth
    'module' sharedirs, and then these are 'new' style sharedirs and are NOT
    compatible with old File::ShareDirs.
