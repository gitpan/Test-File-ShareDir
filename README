        use Test::File::ShareDir
            -root => "$FindBin::Bin/../",
            -share => {
                -module => { 'My::Module' => 'share/MyModule' }
                -dist   => { 'My-Dist'    => 'share/somefolder' }

        use My::Module;

        use File::ShareDir qw( module_dir dist_dir );

DESCRIPTION
    This module only has support for creating 'new' style sharedirs and are
    NOT compatible with old File::ShareDirs.

    For this reason, unless you have File::ShareDir 1.00 or later installed,
    this module will not be usable by you.
