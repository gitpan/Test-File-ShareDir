0.3.0 2011-05-05T03:29:45Z
 [Dependencies::Testing]
 - Now requires Cwd as provided by File-Spec / PathTools.

 [Documentation]
 - Improved primary documentation to explain import flags

 [Features]
 - In the absense of passing the 'root' parameter, it will default to the
   current work directory. Considering that most of the time, the Cwd is
   the project root directory when running tests, this constitutes a
   reasonably sane default.

 [Tests]
 - Now uses Test::CPAN::Changes plugin instead of CPANChangesTests plugin
 - Added 03_cwd.t which tests how the module behaves when -root is
   implicit.
