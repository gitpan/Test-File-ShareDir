 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.2.0, see Changes.deps{,.all,.dev} for

 - Improved primary documentation to explain import flags

 [Features]
 - In the absense of passing the 'root' parameter, it will default to the

   the project root directory when running tests, this constitutes a
   reasonably sane default.

   implicit.
